                The following Health Surveillance / Assessments should be considered based on your company's risk assessments, as you have declared that they are likely to be involved with these types of activities in their new role. Please contact Cordell Health to arrange or provide you with further advice as required if your organisation’s contract doesn’t include the provision of health surveillance.  It is recommended that baseline assessments are undertaken prior to first exposure.
